# Flow Cadut: Flow Cadence Utilites

The Flow Cadence Utilities (`@onflow/flow-cadut`) package is the API responsible for parsing cadence templates, mapping arguments/imports to these templates, and interacting with the chain.  It is the set of runtime utilities which are used behind the scenes by the JavaScript template files generated by `@onflow/flow-cadut-generator`.

For more information, see the [README file](packages/flow-cadut/README.md).

You can find a list of available methods with examples at [API Documentation](/docs/api.md)

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @onflow/flow-cadut
```

## Plugin System

Flow Cadut supports interfacing with plugins in order to extend its native capabiltiies and provide seamless integration into other libraries (i.e. FIND, FLOWNS).

There are two official Flow Cadut plugins currently: `@onflow/flow-cadut-plugin-find` and `@onflow/flow-cadut-plugin-flowns`

For plugin information about plugin usage and how to create a plugin for Flow Cadut, [see here](../../docs/plugins.md).
